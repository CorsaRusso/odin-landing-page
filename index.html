                    For this project you’ll be creating an entire web page from a design we’ll provide for you. If you’ve been following along you should have the skills you need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy! <br></br>The design we’re providing you comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used.

                    <p>There are many ways to tackle a project like this, and it can be overwhelming to look at a blank HTML document and not know where to start. </p>

                    <img src="https://picsum.photos/202?grayscale">
                    <p>Our suggestion: take it one section at a time. The website you’re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer), so pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. </p>

                    <p>Starting at the top is always a solid plan. Many of the elements on this page are very similar to things you saw in our flexbox exercises… feel free to go back to those if you need a refresher.</p>
